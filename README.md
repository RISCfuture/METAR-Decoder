to handle all automated remarks and most human-generated remarks, as long as
they conform to the Federal Meteorological Handbook chapter 12.

## Requirements

decode METARs for:

```` bash
$ METAR\ Decoder PAFA

(R) sea-level pressure 910.6 hPa
(R) barometric pressure 0.4 hPa higher than three hours ago and increasing more slowly
(R) few smoke at surface
(R) 24-hour temperature low 6.7 째C, high 21.1 째C
